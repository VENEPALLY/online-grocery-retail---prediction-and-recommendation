# Enterprise-Grade REST API Project

This project provides a robust and scalable foundation for developing RESTful APIs, built with modern enterprise standards in mind. It is designed to be easily extensible and maintainable, serving as a backend for various applications.

## Features

*   **RESTful API Design:** Adheres to REST principles for clear, stateless communication.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Built with Spring Boot, enabling easy scaling and deployment.
*   **Data Persistence:** Configurable for various SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, H2 for development).
*   **Error Handling:** Centralized exception handling for consistent API responses.
*   **Security Best Practices:** Foundation for integrating authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Clear code and structure for easy understanding and contribution.

## Technologies Used

*   Java 17
*   Spring Boot 3.x
*   Maven
*   H2 Database (for development/testing)
*   PostgreSQL (recommended for production)
*   RESTful APIs

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   JDK 17 or higher
*   Maven 3.x
*   A suitable Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SaiSharathChandraV/enterprise-rest-api.git
    cd enterprise-rest-api
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `https://github.com/SaiSharathChandraV/enterprise-rest-api.git` with the actual repository URL if different.)*

2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with its RESTful APIs using tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl`. Here are some example endpoints (actual endpoints may vary based on implementation):

*   `GET /api/v1/resources` - Retrieve a list of all resources.
*   `GET /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.
*   `POST /api/v1/resources` - Create a new resource (requires a JSON request body).
*   `PUT /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Update an existing resource by its ID (requires a JSON request body).
*   `DELETE /api/v1/resources/{id}` - Delete a resource by its ID.

Refer to any integrated API documentation (e.g., Swagger UI, if enabled) for detailed information on request/response formats and available endpoints.
