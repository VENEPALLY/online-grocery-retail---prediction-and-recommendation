Project based on Kaggle - Instacart Market Basket Analysis
## Summary
Want more personalized grocery recommendations to accommodate your shopping style? Want to save frequent trips to the market? Instacart is a same day grocery delivery app which provides delivery as fast as one hour. Instacart provides personal shoppers, who can shop and deliver groceries at your doorstep saving you time and money.

2. Clustering the customers based on their historical purchase behavior 
3. Recommending relevant products based on cluster and transactional history. 

## Highlights
*	Analyzed a 200,000 user online retail data, did feature engineering and extracted the important features using LightGBM and XGBoost feature importance
*	Segmented Customers based on customer attributes like purchase patterns and products bought by them
*	Conducted a comparative study of various machine learning models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost in Python to predict the products bought by the customers and achieved an accuracy score of 38.09% (highest was 40.90%)
*	Build a recommendation model which provided recommendations to the user based on his/her customer segment and the project associations with the products already placed in the cart using Association Rule Mining (Apriori Algorithm)
